# Context

In the context of [12 Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/ "https://12factor.net/"), it is recommended to store configurations in the environment. However, storing plain credentials directly in the environment is not secure. To overcome this, we need a workaround.

Currently, we are using Secrets Manager to store credentials separately from other configurations. This means that configuring credentials requires extra steps.

# What is shush?

[shush](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/shush "https://github.com/realestate-com-au/shush") is a small tool that can be used to encrypt and decrypt secrets, using the **AWS Key Management Service(KMS).**

# Why shush?

One of the advantages of shush is that it supports decrypting environments with the prefix **KMS_ENCRYPTED_** and puts the plain credentials in the environment variables. This allows us to store the credentials together with other configurations, making it easier to maintain.

And using shush can eliminates the need to manually manage Secrets Manager.

# How to use shush?

## CLI

### Installation

```sh
go get github.com/realestate-com-au/shush
```
Or
```sh
sudo curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/shush \
    "https://github.com/realestate-com-au/shush/releases/download/v1.5.4/shush_$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_/amd/' | sed 's/aarch/arm/')" \
 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/shush
```

### Usage

#### Encrypt

```sh
shush --region ap-southeast-2 encrypt KEY_ID 'this is a plain secret'
```

#### Decrypt

```sh
shush --region ap-southeast-2 decrypt 'this is a encrypted secret'
```

## Command shim in Docker

### Installation

```
# Include "shush" to decode KMS_ENCRYPTED_STUFF
ARG TARGETARCH
RUN curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/shush \
    https://github.com/realestate-com-au/shush/releases/download/v1.5.4/shush_linux_${TARGETARCH} \
 && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/shush
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/shush", "exec", "--"]
```


### Usage Example

#### Configuration

- add the `KMS_ENCRYPTED_DB_PASSWORD` environment variable
  
  ```
  KMS_ENCRYPTED_DB_PASSWORD="encrypted password"
  ```

#### Runtime

1. shush will find `KMS_ENCRYPTED_DB_PASSWORD` in the environment
2. shush will decrypt the content.
3. shush will put the result in a new environment variable `DB_PASSWORD`. The environment will now be:  
    ```
    KMS_ENCRYPTED_DB_PASSWORD="encrypted password"
    DB_PASSWORD="plain password"
    ```
4. start the application

# Summary

Compared to using Secrets Manager, shush allows us to centralize the application's configuration and minimize manual work.
