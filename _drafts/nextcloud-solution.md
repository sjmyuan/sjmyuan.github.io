title: An off-the-self and cheap home server solution

# Why

I always wanted to have a personal home server to store family's files and photos.

There are some off-the-self solutions, Synology for example. But it's too expensive to spend more than 2000ï¿¥ to store files. 

Considering I have a laptop which is almost 10 years old but has 1T storage, I try to build one by myself.

# What

My requirements for the home server are

1. File syncing and access on different platforms, such as Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android
2. Media stream and preview, like video and photos
3. Cloud backup
4. Internet access
5. Support Docker

So my solution are Docker + Nextcloud + rclone + IPv6 + DDNS + AWS Route53 + AWS S3

# How

## Nextcloud

## IPv6

### Router

### Docker

## DDNS and AWS Route53

## rclone
